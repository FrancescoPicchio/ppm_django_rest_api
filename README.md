Django REST API app for creating polls, and submitting and retrieving answers to said polls.

Remember to set API_URL in front-end/src/services/ for both api.js and auth.js to match them with the url of your django rest api.
Same thing for CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS in ppm_django_rest_api/settings.py for the url of your react app
